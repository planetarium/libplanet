    /// analogous to a function, and its instance is analogous to a
    /// <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application">partial
    /// function application</a>, in other words, a function with some bound
    /// arguments.  Those parameters that will be bound at runtime should be
    /// represented as fields or properties in an action class, and bound
    /// argument values to these parameters should be received through
    /// a constructor parameters of that class.</para>
    /// <para>From a perspective of security, an action class belongs to
    /// the network protocol, and property values in an action belong to
    /// a node's will (i.e., a user/player's choice).
    /// That means if you define an action class it also defines what every
    /// honest node can do in the network.  Even if a malicious node changes
    /// their own action code it won't affect other honest nodes in
    /// the network.</para>
    /// <para>For example, where honest nodes share the common action
    /// <c>Heal(Target) => PreviousStates[Target] + 1</c>, suppose a malicious
    /// node <c>m</c> changes their own <c>Heal</c> action code to
    /// <c>Heal(Target) => PreviousStates[Target] + 2</c> (2 instead of 1),
    /// and then send an action <c>Heal(m)</c>.
    /// Fortunately, this action does not work as <c>m</c>'s intention,
    /// because the changed code in itself is not used by other honest nodes,
    /// so they still increase only 1, not 2.  The effect of that double healing
    /// is a sort of &#x201c;illusion&#x201d; only visible to the malicious node
    /// alone.</para>
    /// <para>In conclusion, action code is a part of the protocol and it works with
    /// consensus in the network, so only things each node can affect the network
    /// in general is property values of each action they sign and send,
