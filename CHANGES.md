Libplanet changelog
===================

Version 0.4.0
-------------

To be released.

### Backward-incompatible interface changes

 -  `Swarm` constructor became to receive `BlockChain<T>` and have a type
    parameter `T`.  [[#295]]

### Added interfaces

 -  Added `LiteDBStore` backend that uses [LiteDB] under the hood.  [[#269]]
 -  All `*Async()` methods belonging to `TurnClient` class became to have
    `cancellationToken` option.  [[#287]]

### Behavioral changes

 -  `BlockChain<T>.GetNonce()` became to count staged transactions too during
    nonce computation.  [[#270]]
 -  A message `Swarm` makes became to have multiple blocks within it, which
    means round trips on the network are now much reduced.  [[#273], [#276]]
 -  `Message.Block` has been replaced by `Message.Blocks` and the magic number
    has been changed to `0x0a`.  [[#276]]
 -  Improved performance of `Swarm`'s response time to `GetBlockHashes`
    request messages.  [[#277]]
 -  Added IPv6 support to `Libplanet.Stun.StunAddress`. [[#267], [#271]]

### Bug fixes

 -  Fixed a bug that `Swarm` reported `TaskCanceledException` as an unknown
    exception while stopping. [[#275]]
 -  Fixed a bug that `Swarm` didn't stop properly during `Swarm.Preload()`.
    [[#275]]
 -  Fixed a bug where the oldest `TxNonce` of an address is not invalidated
    when forking using `FileStore.ForkTxNonce()` method.  [[#281]]
 -  Fixed a bug where `LiteDBStore.GetTxNonce()` method throws a
    `System.IO.IOException` after forking.  [[#281]]
 -  Fixed a bug that `TurnClient` had not stopped properly.  [[#287]]

Version 0.3.0
-------------

Released on May 31, 2019.

### Backward-incompatible interface changes

    [[#31], [#212]]
 -  Added `IAction.Unrender(IActionContext, IAccountStateDelta)` method.
    [[#31], [#212]]
 -  `BlockChain<T>.Validate()` method became to receive
    `IReadOnlyList<Block<<T>>` instead of `IEnumerable<Block<T>>`.  [[#205]]
 -  `IBlockPolicy<T>.GetNextBlockDifficulty()` method became to receive
    `IReadOnlyList<Block<<T>>` instead of `IEnumerable<Block<T>>`.  [[#205]]
 -  Added
    `IBlockPolicy<T>.ValidateNextBlock(IReadOnlyList<Block<T>>, Block<T>)`
    method.  [[#210]]
 -  Removed `IBlockPolicy<T>.ValidateBlocks()` method.  [[#210]]
 -  `BlockChain<T>[int]` became to throw `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` instead
    of `IndexOutOfRangeException`.  [[#210]]
 -  Removed `KeyEquals()` methods from all classes and structs.  [[#216]]
 -  `Swarm` class now does not implement `IEquatable<Swarm>` anymore and
    its `Equals(object)` method and `GetHashCode()` method became to have
    default behavior of `object` class.  [[#216]]
 -  Also, `Swarm` class now does not implement `IDisposable` too. Thus
    `Swarm.Dispose()` was removed too. [[#218]]
 -  `Swarm` became to use a queue to maintain internal messages.  [[#218]]
     -  The broadcasting methods are no more `async`, so they are renamed
        as below.
        -  `Swarm.BroadcastBlocksAsync()` → `Swarm.BroadcastBlocks()`
        -  `Swarm.BroadcastTxsAsync()` → `Swarm.BroadcastTxs()`
 -  The type of `Block<T>.Difficulty` is changed to `long` instead of `int`, and
    related classes method parameters and field types have changed accordingly.
 -  Removed `HashDigest.HasLeadingZeroBits()` method.  [[#213]]
 -  The signature of `IStore.PutBlock<T>(Block<T>)` method was changed to
    `PutBlock<T>(Block<T>, Address)`.  [[#189], [#197]]
 -  `Block<T>.Hash` is no longer calculated using the full data of the
    `Transaction<T>`, but is calculated using only the `Transaction<T>.Id`.
    [[#234]]
 -  Added `IStore.LookupStateReference<T>(string, Address, Block<T>)` method.
    [[#232]]
 -  Added `IStore.StoreStateReference<T>(string, Block<T>)` method.
    [[#232]]
 -  Added `IStore.ForkStateReferences<T>(string, string, Block<T>,
    IImmutableSet<Address>` method.  [[#232]]

 -  Added `IStore.ForkTxNonce<T>(string, string, Block<T>,
    IImmutableSet<Address>` method.  [[#246]]

### Added interfaces

 -  `BlockChain<T>` became to implement `IReadOnlyList<Block<T>>`.  [[#205]]
 -  Added `Swarm.DifferentVersionPeerEncountered` event handler that can handle
    events when a different version of a peer is discovered.  [[#167]], [[#185]]
 -  Added `Peer.AppProtocolVersion` property.  [[#185]]
 -  Added `Swarm.PreloadAsync()` method to explicitly and preemptively download
    initial blocks before `Swarm.StartAsync<T>()` being called.
    [[#204]], [[#206]]
 -  Added `BlockDownloadState` class to represent a block downloading state.
    [[#204]], [[#206]]
 -  Added `BlockPolicyExtension.ValidateBlocks<T>(IBlockPolicy<T>,
    IReadOnlyList<Block<T>>, DateTimeOffset)` method.  [[#210]]
 -  Added `Transaction<T>.EvaluateActionsGradually(HashDigest<SHA256>, long,
    IAccountStateDelta, Address, bool)` method.  [[#31], [#212]]
 -  Added `Block<T>.EvaluateActionsPerTx(AccountStateGetter)` method.
    [[#31], [#212]]
 -  Added `HashDigest.Satisfies()` method.  [[#213]]
 -  `BlockPolicy<T>` constructor became to receive the `minimumDifficulty`
    and the mining `difficultyBoundDivisor`.  [[#213]]
 -  Added `BlockChain<T>.UnstageTransactions()` method.  [[#223]]
 -  `Swarm` constructor became to receive a `linger` (or `millisecondsLinger`)
    parameter.  This purposes to determine how long to wait for pending
    messages when a `Swarm` instance is requested to terminate.
 -  Added `NamespaceNotFoundException` class.  [[#232]]
 -  Added `Block<T>.Evaluate()` method.  [[#243]]
 -  Made `InvalidBlockTimestampException` class `public` so that it can be
    caught. [[#133], [#251]]
 -  Added `InvalidTxNonceException` class.  [[#246]]

### Behavioral changes

 -  `Swarm.StartAsync()` now receives the height of blocks (tip `Index`) from
    other known peers and synchronizes the blocks if necessary
    before propagating/receiving pinpointed recent blocks to prevent inefficient
    round-trips.  [[#187], [#190]]
 -  The calculation algorithm of `BlockPolicy<T>.GetNextBlockDifficulty()`
    method was changed to the [Ethereum Homestead algorithm] except for the
    difficulty bomb.  [[#213]]
 -  The difficulty was changed from representing the number of leading zeros of
    target number to representing a divisor to obtain the target number.
    [[#213]]
 -  `BlockSet<T>[int]` changed so as not to validate a block.  [[#231]]
 -  Improved read performance of `Block<T>.Hash` and `Transaction<T>.Id`.
    [[#228], [#234]]
 -  `Swarm.StartAsync()` now does not call `Swarm.StopAsync()` anymore,
    therefore `Swarm.StopAsync()` should be explicitly called.  [[#236]]
 -  `Transaction<T>.EvaluateActionsGradually()` became to record
    `IAccountStateDelta.SetState()` calls even if its argument is the same
    to the previous state. [[#241]]
 -  `Block<T>.Validate()` and `Block<T>.EvaluateActions()` are integrated into
    `Block<T>.Evaluate()`.  [[#243]]
 -  `BlockChain<T>.Append()` became to execute `Action.Execute()` only once per
    action in the `Block<T>`.  [[#243]]
 -  `BlockChain<T>.Append()` method became to throw `InvalidTxNonceException`
    when the `Transaction<T>.Nonce` does not correspond to its `Signer`'s
    current nonce.  [[#246]]
 -  `Swarm` became to enforce `ForceDotNet.Force()` in [AsyncIO] while it's running on
    Mono runtime.  [[#247]]

### Bug fixes

 -  Fixed a bug that TURN relay had been disconnected when being connected for
    longer than 5 minutes.  [[#198]]
 -  Fixed a bug that `Swarm` had attempted to use TURN relay even if the `host`
    argument was given.  [[#198]]
 -  Improved the read throughput of `BlockChain<T>.Append()`.
 -  Improved overall read throughput of `BlockChain<T>` while blocks are being
    mined by `BlockChain<T>.MineBlock()`.  [[#191]]
 -  Fixed a bug that `TurnClientException` had been thrown by Swarm when a STUN
    nonce is stale.  [[#193]]
 -  Fixed `BlockChain<T>.GetStates()` had descended to the bottom
    (i.e., the genesis block) where a given `Address` refers to
    a nonexistent account (i.e., never used before).  [[#189], [#192]]
 -  Fixed a bug that a TURN connection had turned unavailable after
    it once failed to parse a message (due to a corrupted packet).
    [[#215]]
 -  Instead of validating the entire blocks, `BlockChain<T>.Append()` method
    became to validate only the next block to be appended.  [[#210]]
 -  Improved `BlockChain<T>.Fork()` performance by avoiding double validation
    of already validated blocks.  [[#215]]
 -  Removed unnecessary writer locks on `BlockChain<T>.StageTransactions()`.
    [[#217]]
 -  Improved concurrency of `BlockChain<T>.Append()` method by removing
    unnecessary race conditions. [[#217]]
 -  Fixed a bug that `Swarm` could not properly communicate with `Peer` behind
    NAT. [[#240]]
 -  Fixed a bug that `BlockChain<T>.FindNextHashes()` throws
    `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` when chain is empty.
 -  Fixed a bug that `TurnClient.AcceptRelayedStreamAsync()`didn't handle
    concurrent connections correctly. [[#256]]

Version 0.2.2
-------------

Released on April 12, 2019.

 -  Fixed a bug that `BlockChain<T>.GetStates()` had returned slower than
    necessary for many addresses.  [[#189], [#192]]

[#189]: https://github.com/planetarium/libplanet/issues/189
[#192]: https://github.com/planetarium/libplanet/pull/192


Version 0.2.1
-------------

Released on April 7, 2019.

This version purposes to entirely replace *0.2.0*, because a wrong *.nupkg*
file was uploaded to *0.2.0* on NuGet Gallery.  Note that *0.2.0* on NuGet
Gallery was unlisted.


Version 0.2.0
-------------

Released on April 5, 2019.

 -  `PrivateKey.Decrypt()` now throws an `InvalidCiphertextException`
    instead of returning `null` when `cipherText` is invalid.  [[#140]]
 -  `Transaction<T>`'s `Sender`–`Recipient` model was replaced by
    `Signer`–`UpdatedAddresses` model.   Unlike cryptocurrencies,
    transactions in games are not necessarily a transfer of assets,
    so it is difficult to determine what type of assert is transferred
    or who will receives the asset.  A more useful perspective is,
    like what kind of transformation is performed, or what states
    are changed.  To be close to this perspective, we decided to
    get rid of `Transaction<T>.Recipient` (which is singular) and
    have `Transaction<T>.UpdatedAddresses` (which is plural) instead.
    As there is no more asset to transfer, the term `Sender` was also
    renamed to `Signer`, which fits more to the new perspective.
    [[#121]]

     -  Renamed `Transaction<T>.Sender`, `RawTransaction.Signer`, and
        `IActionContext.From` properties to `Signer`.
        The corresponding parameter names on constructors and
        methods were also renamed too.
     -  Old `Transaction<T>.Make()` factory method is replaced by
        new `Transaction<T>.Create()` factory method.  The `timestamp` parameter
        became optional, and the new optional `updatedAddresses` parameter was
        added.
     -  Removed `IActionContext.To` property.
     -  `Transaction<T>.Recipient` and `RawTransaction.Recipient` properties
        were replaced by `Transaction<T>.UpdatedAddresses` and
        `RawTransaction.UpdatedAddresses` properties.
        The corresponding parameter names on constructors and methods were
        replaced too.
     -  Since the schema of `RawTransaction` class was changed,
        the serialization format of transactions and blocks were also changed.
        It affects to the way to generate `Transaction<T>.Signature`,
        `Transaction<T>.Id`, and `Block.Hash` values as well.
     -  Added `InvalidTxUpdatedAddressesException` exception class.
     -  A nullary overload of `Block<T>.Validate()` method was gone
        so that the block validation API is always time-wise.
        Instead, `Block<T>.Validate()` method now has only one overload:
        `Validate(DateTimeOffset, AccountStateGetter)` returning
        `IAccountStateDelta`.
     -  `Block<T>.Validate()` and `BlockChain<T>.Validate()` methods now can
        throw an `InvalidTxUpdateAddressesException`.

 -  The `Address`es `IAction` tries to update no more need to be manually
    coded using `IAction.RequestStates()` method.  That method was
    removed at all, and updated `Address`es became automatically determined
    (for the most cases) by track "dirties" on <dfn>rehearsal mode<dfn>.
    This mode dry-runs `IAction`s with empty `IActionContext.PreviousStates`.
    [[#121]]

     -  Added `AccountStateGetter` delegate to provide a read-only view to
        account states.
     -  Added `IAccountStateDelta` interface to replace `AddressStateMap`.
        The interface purposes to provide a read-write view to account states
        with maintaining `UpdatedAddresses` (so-called "dirty").
        [[#98]]
     -  The type of `IActionContext.PreviousStates` property was changed from
        `AddressStateMap` to `IAccountStateDelta`.
     -  Added `IActionContext.Rehearsal` property.  [[#131], [#135]]
     -  Added `UnexpectedlyTerminatedTxRehearsalException` class.
        [[#132], [#136]]
     -  The return type of `IAction.Execute()` method was changed from
        `AddressStateMap` to `IAccountStateDelta`.
     -  Removed `IAction.RequestStates()` method because there is no need for it
        and thus it is not used anymore.
     -  Added `Transaction<T>.EvaluateActions()` method.
     -  Added `Block<T>.EvaluateActions()` generator method.

 -  The built-in subtype polymorphism of `IAction` and `Transaction<T>` was
    moved to a separated new `PolymorphicAction<T>` abstract class.
    Polymorphic actions now should be wrapped by `PolymorphicAction<T>`.
    For example, the following code:

    ~~~~ csharp
    public abstract class AbstractAction : IAction { ... }

    [ActionType("attack")]
    public sealed class Attack : AbstractAction { ... }

    [ActionType("sleep")]
    public sealed class Sleep : AbstractAction { ... }
    ~~~~

    ~~~~ csharp
    var tx = Transaction<AbstractAction>.Create(
        ...,
        actions: new[] { new Attack(...), ... }
    );
    ~~~~

    should be changed to like:

    ~~~~ csharp
    var tx = Transaction<PolymorphicAction<AbstractAction>>.Create(
        ...,
        actions: new[] {
            new PolymorphicAction<AbstractAction>(new Attack(...)),
            ...
        }
    );
    ~~~~

    It can be simpler by implicit casting:

    ~~~~ csharp
    var tx = Transaction<PolymorphicAction<AbstractAction>>.Create(
        ...,
        actions: new PolymorphicAction<AbstractAction>[] { new Attack(...), }
    );
    ~~~~

    [[#169]]

     -  The type parameter `T` of `Transaction<T>`, `Block<T>`, and
        `BlockChain<T>` became to require having a `public` parameterless
        constructor (i.e., `new()`) besides implementing `IAction` interface.
        This means an `abstract class` or an `interface` no more can be passed
        to `T`, but only a concrete `class` or a `struct` can be passed.

 -  Fixed a bug that mutating a collection of `IAction`s passed to
    constructors or factory methods of `Transaction<T>` had affected
    made instances as well.
    The type of `Transaction<T>.Actions` property was changed from
    `IList<T>` to `IImmutableList<T>`.  The corresponding parameters on
    constructors and factory methods also were changed to take
    `IEnumerable<T>` instead of `IList<T>`.
 -  `Address` and `TxId` are now serializable.
    [[#99], [#124] by Qria]
 -  `InvalidTxException` and its subclasses became to have `TxId` property
    and the corresponding constructor parameter.  This can be useful when
    multiple `Transaction<T>` objects are validated at once.
 -  Added `Address.Size` constant, which is fixed to the `Int32` 20.
 -  Fixed a bug that `Block<T>.Validate()` had not thrown `InvalidTxException`
    even if there is any integrity error on its `Transactions`.
 -  Improved the write throughput of `BlockChain<T>` while polling
    `BlockChain<T>.GetStates()`
 -  `Swarm.AddPeersAsync()` was fixed so that unreachable `Peer`s are ignored.
    [[#128]]
 -  `Swarm` became able to relay their connection via TURN ([RFC 5766])
    to NAT traversal. To enable this, its constructor (`Swarm()`) takes the
    newly added `IceServer`s as configuration.
 -  Since we decided to depend on TURN ([RFC 5766]) and STUN ([RFC 5389]) to
    work around NAT so that `Peer`'s endpoints don't have to be multiple,
    `Peer.Urls` was renamed to `Peer.EndPoint` and its type also was changed
    from `IImmutableList<Uri>` to `DnsEndPoint`.
    [[#120], [#123] by Yang Chun Ung, [#126], [#127], [#165], [#166]]
 -  `Swarm` became to ignore tip blocks of the same height (`Index`) that it
    already has and deal with only longer (higher) blocks.
 -  Fixed a bug that occured when `Swarm` was handling multiple responses at the
    same time.
 -  Fixed a bug that the `Swarm` constructor had hanged in certain runtimes
    like Unity engine.
 -  Removed `AddressTransactionSet` which handles handle `Address` to
    `IEnumerable<TxId>` indices, and the following methods in `IStore`:
     -  `IStore.IterateAddresses()`
     -  `IStore.GetAddressTransactionIds()`
     -  `IStore.AppendAddressTransactionId()`
     -  `IStore.CountAddresses()`
 -  Added `IStore.ListNamespaces()` method.
 -  `IStore.CountBlocks()` and `IStore.CountTransactions()` became to return
    `long`.
 -  Block/tx-related methods in `IStore` and `BaseIndex<T>` no longer
    accepts `@namespace` parameter.  It means that even if a forking occurs, the
    same block/tx files are shared.
 -  Fixed a bug that made unnecessary fork when receiving blocks from other
    peer.
 -  Action classes that implement `IAction` but lack `ActionTypeAttribute`
    became reported by `PolymorphicAction<T>` throwing
    `MissingActionTypeException` at runtime.  [[#28], [#144], [#169]]
 -  Turn into parameter in `BlockPolicy`'s constructor to milliseconds. [[#151]]
 -  `BencodexFormatter` became able to serialize `BigInteger`.  [[#159]]
 -  Made `Swarm` possible to configure its network `appProtocolVersion` and,
    to ignore peers if their version is different.  [[#167]], [[#170]]
 -  Added `IActionContext.Miner` property.  [[#173]], [[#174]]
 -  Renamed `Block<T>.RewardBeneficiary` to `Block<T>.Miner`.  [[#174]]
 -  Added `BlockChain<T>.Blocks` property.  [[#176]]
 -  Added `BlockChain<T>.Transactions` property.  [[#176]]
