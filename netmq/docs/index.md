NetMQ is a 100% native C# port of ZeroMQ, a lightweight messaging library.

NetMQ extends the standard socket interface with features traditionally provided by specialised messaging middleware products. NetMQ sockets provide an abstraction of asynchronous message queues, multiple messaging patterns, message filtering (subscriptions), seamless access to multiple transport protocols and more.

## Documentation

NetMQ documentation is available at [netmq.readthedocs.org](http://netmq.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

Using NetMQ requires an understanding of ZeroMQ, for which there is no better documentation than the [ZeroMQ Guide](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all).

## Installation

You can install NetMQ from [NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/NetMQ/).
